If the online transaction is prohibited as per regulations in India or is considered as high risk by HSBC, such transactions will not be approved.\"\\r\\nCan I use the same One Time Password (OTP) password for multiple transactions?,\"No, your One Time Password (OTP) can be used for a single transaction only.\"\\r\\nCan I use the same Securepay password for multiple transactions?,\"Yes, Primary cardholders can use the Securepay password for multiple transactions.\"\\r\\nWhat happens if I enter wrong OTP or wrong Securepay password multiple times?,\"In case you enter the wrong OTP or the wrong Securepay password three times successively, or if the combination of wrong OTP/Securepay password totals three attempts your transaction will be declined and the authentication service will be blocked.\\nKindly note you will not be able to switch from SMS OTP to Securepay password option or vice versa in an event you have entered wrong OTP or the wrong Securepay password three times successively.\"\\r\\nHow can I unblock the VBV/MSC in case it gets blocked?,\"Primary credit card holders can login to Internet Banking and unblock their VBV/MSC password under the \"\"Securepay\"\" tab in case it gets blocked due to three incorrect attempts.\\nAdd-on credit cardholders would need to call HSBC India Phone Banking numbers to get their VBV/MSC unblocked.\"\\r\\n\"If I do not have my mobile number registered with HSBC INDIA, can I still make an online transaction with my HSBC credit card?\",\"Primary cardholders without the mobile number registered with HSBC India can use the Securepay password for online transactions. However, primary cardholders who have not registered for Internet Banking and have not set up their Securepay password and Addon cardholders will have only the SMS OTP service for authentication of online transactions on websites/IVR systems that support Verified by VISA/MasterCard\\xae SecureCode authentication protocol. HSBC provides the OTP on your registered mobile number and therefore in the absence of a registered mobile number you will not be able to complete the online transaction.\\nWe suggest that you register your mobile number with HSBC so that you are able to receive the OTP by way of an SMS for online transaction authentication in addition to transaction alerts. You may call the HSBC PhoneBanking number for immediate updation of the mobile number. The records will be updated subject to successful verifications.\"\\r\\n\"I have a HSBC primary card, how do I create the Securepay password?\",\"Primary cardholders will need to self-register for Internet Banking.

By offering you a choice of the authentication service, we make it convenient for you to transact online. If a valid mobile number is registered with HSBC, you will automatically receive the SMS OTP for online/IVR transactions. You may decide to use either the Securepay password or the SMS OTP for authentication.\"\\r\\n\"I have created an IVR OTP in Internet Banking and yet I receive another OTP via SMS during my IVR transaction, which one should I use?\",\"You may use either of the OTPs. However please note that the IVR OTP you create in Internet Banking is valid for a single transaction within 6 hours, whereas the SMS OTP is valid for a single transaction within 5 minutes.\"\\r\\nCan HSBC resend the OTP to me in case of non-receipt?,\"The OTP will be sent to your registered mobile number as soon as the online transaction request is received by the bank from the merchant\\'s website; however due to network issues there could be a delay in receipt of the OTP via SMS.

You can call the HSBC PhoneBanking number for immediate updation of the mobile number. The records will be updated subject to successful verifications.\"\\r\\nWhat happens to the Securepay password I had created on Internet Banking for my primary card?,\"In case of primary cardholders, the Securecode password created on Internet Banking can be used.\"\\r\\nDoes the implementation of SMS OTP authentication mean that the Securepay password authentication was not secure?,\"No, Securepay password authentication is also secure.

It will not be displayed in case of authentication via SMS OTP functionality.\\r\\nWhat is EMV Chip Card?,\"EMV (Europay MasterCard Visa) is a global security standard for chip card technology. It enables chip cards to be accepted anywhere in the world. With the EMV Smart Chip, your card is better protected against fraudulent usage.\"\\r\\nHow does this security feature impact the usage of HSBC credit cards?,\"At HSBC, it is our endeavor to offer you secure ways to transact by adopting the latest technology. Chip cards offer a global security standard in card technology and are safer than magnetic stripe cards. A magnetic stripe card can be easily cloned. A chip card, however, contains a microprocessor chip that uses encryption to prevent its contents from being replicated.\\nThe Chip cards from HSBC are classified as \"\"Chip and PIN\"\" credit cards. These cards offer the safety of Chip cards and incorporate another layer of security in the form of PIN validation. You will be required to authenticate your purchases at merchant outlets using your 6-digit ATM PIN at the electronic Point of Sale (POS) terminal, in addition to your signing the sales slip, to complete the payment.\"\\r\\nDo I have to pay for my new HSBC Chip credit card?,\"No replacement fee will be levied for the issuance of chip credit card. For replacements due to stolen / lost / damaged cards, and new credit cards issued, replacement charges/card fees will be levied as per the tariff applicable to your credit card.\"\\r\\nDo I have to ask for a new PIN for the replaced Chip credit card?,\"No, your current ATM PIN on the existing credit card can be used on as the PIN for your replacement card. In case you do not know the PIN of your existing credit card, you could call HSBC PhoneBanking to request for a new credit card ATM PIN.\"\\r\\nCan I use the HSBC Chip credit card for online transactions as well as at Point Of Sale (POS) terminals?,\"Yes, you can use the HSBC Chip credit card for POS as well as for online transactions at websites that accept Visa/MasterCard credit cards. Online card usage will require authentication of the transaction by entering the 6 digit OTP (One Time Password). HSBC has rolled out an SMS OTP functionality for easier use during both online and IVR transactions. If you had previously created Verified by Visa (VBV)/ Mastercard SecureCode (MSC) passwords, you can no longer use them. Instead, the HSBC SMS OTP authentication service will automatically trigger authentication for your online/IVR transactions via the SMS OTP.\\nPlease refer to the FAQ on Implementation of SMS OTP authentication for Primary and Add-on cards for further details.\\nUsage at POS terminals present at merchant establishment will require you to input your 6 digits ATM PIN number, to validate the transaction. Incorrect ATM PIN will not validate the transaction and the same shall not be processed. In case you do not have an ATM PIN, please place your request for the same on HSBC Phone Banking /HSBC Personal Internet Banking. You may also visit your nearest HSBC Branch and place a request for an ATM PIN. Upon request the ATM PIN shall be sent to your mailing address.\"\\r\\nCan I use the HSBC Chip credit card overseas?,\"Yes. Depending on the capability of the overseas POS terminal, you may be required to validate your purchases using your 6-digit Credit card ATM PIN in addition to signing the sales slip. Please note, in some countries/regions chip cards are not prevalent and not all POS terminals can accept chip cards. Your card transactions in these countries/regions will revert to using magnetic stripe instead.\"\\r\\nWould the HSBC Chip credit card be accepted by all merchants?,Yes. The Chip credit card also has a magnetic strip to ensure acceptance even at merchants whose POS terminals do not have Chip card capability. Hence the HSBC Chip credit card can be used at most card accepting merchants in the same way as the magnetic strip cards are used.\\r\\nHow do I use my HSBC Chip Credit Card?,\"1.\\tThe merchant will dip the Chip Card into the POS terminal\\'s card reader and enter the amount to be paid by you.\\n2.\\tThe POS terminal will ask for your PIN, which will be your 6 digit Credit card ATM PIN.\\n3.\\tYou will be required to enter your Credit Card ATM pin on the Point of Sales (POS) machine in addition to signing the charge slip for the purchase transaction to successfully go through.\\n4.\\tThe Merchant hands over your copy of the Sales slip along with the Chip Card.\"\\r\\nWhat is Payment Hierarchy?,\"Payment hierarchy is an allocation of payment on your credit card account for different plan types which currently includes EMI as applicable on balance build products like Loan on Phone/Cash on EMI/Instant EMI, purchases, cash withdrawal and Balance Transfer option.\"\\r\\nHow has the current payment hierarchy changed?,\"The allocation of payments will now be towards high interest bearing plans, followed by lower interest bearing plans in a descending order.\"\\r\\nWhen is the new payment hierarchy coming into effect?,The new payment hierarchy will come into effect on 5 August 2013.\\r\\nHow is the new payment allocation logic (payment hierarchy) different from the existing one?,\"Before the new payment allocation was put in place, payments made to the cardholder\\'s account will be settled in the order of Minimum Payment Due, Balance Transfer (BT) outstanding, fees and charges, Cash advances and Purchase outstanding.\\n\\n\\nEffective 5 August 2013, in the revised hierarchy, the payment allocation will take place to the extent of Minimum Payment Due, in order of the following \"\"plans\"\" i.e. EMI, Cash advances, Purchase outstanding and Balance Transfer, in descending order of interest rates.\\n \\nIn addition, the allocation of payment will be such that the transaction/fees billed after your last statement but not yet paid, will get paid off before any charges/fees incurred after your last statement date and are yet to be reflected on your statement.\"\\r\\nHow will the new payment hierarchy affect me?,\"Any payment in excess of the Minimum Payment Due will be applied to the plans with the highest interest rate first. Hence, you will benefit by way of lower interest expenses incurred on the credit card. However, the impact of the new payment allocation logic will vary for different card accounts depending on the nature of spends and usage of the credit card.\"\\r\\nWhat will be the payment allocation if I pay more than the statement balance?,\"Any payments in excess of the statement balance will be allocated to any unbilled fees and charges followed by the unbilled principal balances, starting from balances with the highest interest rate, in the credit card account, if any.\"\\r\\n\"I have further queries on the new payment hierarchy, whom should I contact?\",You may call our PhoneBanking numbers mentioned on the back of your credit card or on our websiteon our website Find contact numbers.\\r\\nNeed additional limit?,You might choose to increase the credit limit on your credit card from time to time in order to accommodate unforeseen expenses while travelling overseas or to pay for large purchases conveniently.\\r\\nHow do I increase the credit limit on my Credit Card.
